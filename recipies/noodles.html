    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Noodles are a popular food enjoyed all around the world in many different forms. 
        They are typically made from wheat, rice, or other grains and can 
        be cooked by boiling or stir-frying. Originating thousands of years 
        ago in <strong>Asia</strong>, noodles have become a staple in cuisines like Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Thai.</p>
